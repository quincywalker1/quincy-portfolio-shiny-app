Welcome to my Github!!
This is my Repository responsible for the back-end of my Rshiny Web App and where you can check out how I have organized everything.

Reason(s) why I am using RShiny:
1. It's Free to publish.
2. Show's my capabilities as a Data Scientist that perfers R.
3. You can also use Python within R.
